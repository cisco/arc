package resource

// SubnetGroups provides the resource interface used for the common subnet groups
// object implemented in the arc package. SubnetGroups is a collection
// of SubnetGroup objects, so it has a Find method associated with it.
// Since this is a collection object, having a pointer to it's parent
// isn't practical.
type SubnetGroups interface {
	Resource
	Auditor

	// Find the subnet group with the given name.
	Find(name string) SubnetGroup

	// Get provides access to SubnetGroups' children subnet groups.
