# Github Development Process - Fork / Travis Model

This process assumes you are going to fork https://github.com:cisco/arc to your own account and
work from there.

The advantage to this is that you can setup your own personal travis-ci account to build development
branches as you commit code, before you create a pull request in cisco/arc.

You can setup your personal travis-ci account here: https://travis-ci.org/profile.


## Creating the fork

Just head over to the https://github.com/cisco/arc and click the "Fork" button. You want the fork to be located in [username]/arc.


## Cloning the repo

Clone your fork to your local machine. This assumes your are in the root of your go workspace.
This needs to be placed in github.com/cisco/arc to satisfy the go import paths.
```shell
git clone git@github.com:[username]/arc src/github.com/cisco/arc
```

Add cisco/arc as the upstream repo
```shell
git remote add upstream git@github.com:cisco/arc
```

Verify that the "upstream" remote exists.
```shell
git remote -v

```


## Make changes

Create the development branch
```shell
git checkout -b [development_branch]
```

... make changes ...

Commits go to your local development branch. For each commit to the branch use the
general form "Issue #N: ..." where N is the issue number of the problem being worked.
```shell
git commit -m "Issue #N: ..."
```

This pushes the commited changes in your workspace to your account.
If you have setup a personal travis-ci build, this will kickoff it off.
```shell
git push origin [development_branch]
```


## Pull request

Sync your master branch with the upstream master.
```shell
git fetch upstream
git checkout master
git merge --ff-only upstream/master
```

Rebase your development branch to pull in any changes from the upstream master.
```shell
git checkout [development_branch]
git rebase master
```

... re-build / test ...

Once your development branch is available go to https://github.com/[username]/arc/pulls and create a pull request.

The base fork will be: **cisco/arc**, base branch: **master**.
The head fork will be: **[username]/arc**, compare branch: **[development_branc]**

### For reviewers that triage the pull request

Please assign the attributes to the pull request.

- Reviewers: arc-committers
- Assignees: [PR author]
- Projects:  arc (by default)

This will cause email to be sent out to the reviewers.

When ready to merge the PR use the **Squash** or  **Rebase** options, preferring squashing.

After the PR is merged, delete the branch associated with the PR. We will only use one development branch per PR.

If the issue associated with the PR is complete, mark it as closed.


## Post PR changes

If you need to make changes to your pull request, work on your development as if you were doing regular development. Since you are working on a branch, you want to create a new commit to the branch. You do not need to (and should not) amend the last commit.


Always remember to sync your development with the upstream/master before pushing up any changes.
```shell
git fetch upstream
git checkout master
git merge --ff-only upstream/master
git checkout [development_branch]
git rebase master
```


Once you commit the code to your local branch, push the branch up to your fork as your did before.  If your commit included changes from upstream, or it includes an amended a commit, you must use a force push (-f flag to push).

```shell
git push -f origin [development_branch]
```

Since the branch associate with the PR has been updated, travis-ci will start a new build.


## Cleanup the development branch

After the PR has merged, you no longer need your development branch. Switch to your master branch.
```shell
git checkout master
```

Since the development branch has been deleted upstream, this will remove it from your local workspace.
```shell
git fetch --all --prune
```

This will delete your development branch from your personal github account.
```shell
git push origin :[development_branch]
```

This will delete your development branch from your local workspace.
```shell
git branch -D [development_branch]
```


## Syncing master to upstream

Pull a copy of the upstream repo. If you just did a fetch as part of the branch cleanup you do not need to do it again.
```shell
git fetch upstream
```

Checkout your master branch and merge from the upstream repos using fast forward only. Since we are not making changes on master we should always be able to fast forward.
```shell
git checkout master
git merge --ff-only upstream/master
```

Push the merged branch up to your github account to keep it in sync with the upstream repo.
```shell
git push
```
