# Github Development Process - Fork / Travis Model

This process assumes you are going to fork github.com:cisco/arc to your own account and
work from there.

The advantage to this is that you can setup your own personal travis to build development
branches as you commit code, before you create a pull request in cisco/arc.

You can setup your personal travis here: https://travis-ci.org/profile.


## Creating the fork

Just head over to the https://github.com/cisco/arc and click the "Fork" button. You want the fork to be located in [username]/arc.


## Cloning the repo

Clone your fork to your local machine
```shell
git clone git@github.com:[username]/arc src/github.com/cisco/arc
```

Add cisco/arc as the upstream repo
```shell
git remote add upstream git@github.com:cisco/arc
```

Verify that the "upstream" remote exists.
```shell
git remote -v

```


## Make changes

Create the development branch
```shell
git checkout -b [branch_name]
```

... make changes ...

Commits go to your local development branch. For each commit to the branch use the
general form "Issue #N: ..." where N is the issue number of the problem being worked.
```shell
git commit -m "Issue #N, ..."
```

This pushes the commited changes in your workspace to your account.
If you have setup a personal travis build, this will kickoff it off.
```shell
git push origin [branch_name]
```


## Pull request

Sync your master branch with the upstream master.
```shell
git fetch upstream
git checkout master
git merge --ff-only upstream/master
```

Rebase your changes to pull in any changes on the upstream master.
```shell
git checkout [branch_name]
git rebase master
```

... re-build / test ...

Push your development branch upstream. This will kickoff a travis build for cisco/arc.
```shell
git push upstream [branch_name]
```

Once your development branch is available goto https://github.com/cisco/arc/pulls and create a pull request
with the following attributes:

- Reviewers: arc-committers
- Assignees: _yourself_
- Projects:  arc

This will cause email to be sent out to the reviewers.

When ready to merge a PR use the **Rebase** option.

After the PR is merged, delete the branch associated with the PR. We will only use one development branch per PR.

If the issue associated with the PR is complete, mark it as closed.


## Cleanup the development branch

After the PR has merged, you no longer need your development branch.
```shell
git checkout master
```

Since the development branch has been deleted upstream, this will remove it from your local copy.
```shell
git fetch --all --prune
```

This will delete your development branch from your personal github account.
```shell
git push origin :[branch_name]
```

This will delete your development from your local workspace.
```shell
git branch -D [branch_name]
```


## Syncing master to upstream

```shell
# Pull a copy of the upstream repo.
git fetch upstream

# Merge to code from upstream. You fast forward only, since you should not be making changes on this branch.
git checkout master
git merge --ff-only upstream/master

# Push the merged branch up to your github account to keep it in sync with the upstream repo.
git push
```
